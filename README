# status

work in progress (though stalled now).  there is some basic,
incomplete, insecure code to make a connection and execute a
command, and a start of sftpfs.  this is interesting for developers
only!


# intro

this package contains an ssh client, sftpfs and the library that
the client uses.  the goals are to let plan 9 & inferno users use
resources from another (unix) machine: interactive shell, file
server, and eventually network.  for the future, an ssh server is
planned.


# install

first, make sure you have "util" installed.

change mkconfig if you do not have $ROOT set.  now "mk install" to
compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.


# download

the latest version can be found at:

    http://www.ueber.net/code/r/ssh


# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo

- security problem:  i don't know how big (number of bits) the dh
  client side secret should be, and whether we should verify if it's
  correct/secure.

- sshlib: rekeying
- sftpfs: use ssh command, don't use sshlib directly.
- sftpfs: find & fix races with fids
- sftpfs: more proper accounting of open/closed files
- sftpfs: look at iounit & max packet sizes.

- factotum:  dsa,rsa: try all matching keys (or, send public key to sshd to ask whether it is eligible for authentication).
- factotum:  change proto=rsa & proto=dsa to not query user for keys if none matching.
        IO.findkeys() probably needs flag to not require a match:
        "keymanc <-= (attrs, 1, kc);     # TO DO: 1 => 0 for not needed"
- sshlib: check that dh param from server is valid/sane?
- sshlib: zero out sensitive data after use.  can we do that with ipint too?  and encryption algorithm state.
- think about sshnet
- manual pages
- sshlib: do auth keyboard-interactive?  is there a generic challenge-response method in factotum?

- sshlib: make it faster.  the expmod() calls for the dh exchange take up seconds.  perhaps i use too many bits?
- sshlib: do rfc4419 "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256".  inferno first needs sha256 for that.
- sshlib: compression.  it's hard in inferno, because we have to flush the
  buffers for each packet (but keep compression state).  inferno's
  deflate filter doesn't support that.
- crypto:  cast128-cbc, test/fix blowfish, sha256, ripemd160
- test IDEA?
- test against other sshd's than openssh (e.g. dropbear, lsh, more?)


# docs

see doc/rfc.txt for the relevant rfc's and some excerpts from it.

extra/* contains support for rsa & dsa keys (rsa is slightly different
in ssh2 from ssh1).

sshpubkey turns the public part of key (from factotum, or as generated
by dsagen,rsagen) into a string you can put in an openssh
.ssh/authorized_keys.
