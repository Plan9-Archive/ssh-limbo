# status

work in progress.  there is some basic, incomplete, insecure (!)
code to make a connection and execute a command.


# about

this package contains a ssh client & the the library that the client
uses.  an ssh server is not plannend.  the goals is to let plan 9
& inferno users use resources from another (unix) machine:  interactive
shell, file server, network.


# todo

- big security problem:  diffie-helmann key exchange uses the same
  client-side secret, probably may too small too.
- big security problem:  the rsa signature from the server, on the
  last key exchange message, isn't verified.

- support more algorithms?  e.g. more key exchange, more encryption,
  authentication (integrity).  perhaps even compression (should be
  easy).
- separate library & client a bit more.  a client should dial, then
  "login", resulting in an ssh connection over which a shell, command,
  network stuff or a subsystem can be requested.
- after the client is somewhat working (interactive shell), it's
  time to implement sshfs (using sftp), and sshnet.
