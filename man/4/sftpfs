.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sftpfs
translates between styx messages and sftp (version 3) messages.  If
.I addr
is specified,
.IR ssh (1)
is executed to connect to the address request the sftp subsystem.
Otherwise
.I sshcmd
specified with
.B -s
is executed.
The home directory on the remote server is mounted by default,
another path (relative to the home directory, or an absolute path) can be specified by
.IR remotepath .
Option
.B -d
causes debug messages to be printed.
Option
.B -D
causes sftp message traces to be printed.
.PP
.I Sftpfs
does not immediately connect to the server.  It answers the ``version''
and ``attach'' styx messages without sftp connection.  Only for
later styx messages (e.g. ``walk'') will a connection be started.
If the connection is idle for more than
.I idlesecs
seconds, and no files are open, the connection is closed.  This
makes it possible to start sftpfs at boot time without it using
resources immediately.  The default value is 180 seconds.  With
zero or a negative value sftpfs never disconnects idle connections.
.PP
Styx requests are handled ``asynchronously'', meaning they are
translated into an sftp request and queued for later response.  In
the mean time a next styx styx is processed.  This should result
in decent performance of concurrent styx requests over high latency
connections.
.SH EXAMPLE
Mount files from ``dis'':
.EX
	mount -c {sftpfs dis} /n/dis

.SH BUGS
Some styx requests require multiple sftp requests.  The styx operation
may no longer be atomic.  For
.IR wstat (5)
the attributes are set first, then the name is changed.  A null
.IR wstat (5)
has no equivalent sftp operation so returns success immediately.
.br
Open or create with
.BR ORCLOSE ,
.BR DMAPPEND ,
or
.B DMEXCL
is not supported and returns an error.
.br
Sftp servers only send numeric uids and gids.  Sftp does not currently
have a mechanism to translate them to names.
